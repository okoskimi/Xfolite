Note: This is a straight export from a local copy of the now
offline Nokia SVN repo that housed the Xfolite project.
Although J2ME Polish is still available, the project might
not build with the latest version (2.4). You can find older
versions from http://sourceforge.net/projects/polish.berlios/files/

-----------------
Xfolite is a light-weight XForms client for the J2ME platform.
It includes a DOM and XPath 1.0 implementation as well as an
XForms engine that implements the XForms 1.1 specification
almost completely. XML Schemas are not supported.

To compile the code, you need to install J2ME Polish
(http://www.j2mepolish.org/, tested with version 2.1.4) and
Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/, tested with version 1.8.0).
The build command is "ant j2mepolish" to make a release build
and "ant test j2mepolish" to make a debug build. "ant clean"
will remove files created by the two previous commands.
See J2ME Polish documentation for more information on the
build process.

This is a research prototype, and the code maturity level
varies by component. The DOM and XPath 1.0 implementation
and the XForms engine are fairly mature, whereas the user
interface binding  (com.nokia.xfolite.client,
com.nokia.xfolite.client.ui) is beta level at best - suitable
for research and limited user trials, but production use
would require more work, both for adding missing features
and for making existing features more robust.

The package structure is as follows:

com.nokia.xfolite.client
  Client midlet and UI factory and controller that bind the XForms engine to a J2ME Polish based UI.

com.nokia.xfolite.client.ui
  UI widgets used by the client midlet.

com.nokia.xfolite.client.util
  Helper classes

com.nokia.xfolite.xforms.dom
  XForms specific DOM element classes

com.nokia.xfolite.xforms.model
  XForms calculation engine

com.nokia.xfolite.xforms.model.datasource
  Support for using sensors from XForms (not used at the moment)

com.nokia.xfolite.xforms.model.datatypes
  Support for the most important XML Schema datatypes used by XForms

com.nokia.xfolite.xforms.submission
  Submission formats and serialization

com.nokia.xfolite.xforms.xpath
  XForms-specific XPath functions

com.nokia.xfolite.xml.dom
  Basic DOM implementation

com.nokia.xfolite.xml.dom.events
  DOM events

com.nokia.xfolite.xml.xpath
  XPath 1.0

org.bouncycastle.crypto
